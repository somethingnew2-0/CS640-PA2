Bufferbloat report

Part 2:
1.039s wget time

Part 3:
Ping avg: 707ms
4.315s wget time

Why does the web page take so much longer to download?
It is receiving the file over the same connection that we have a high speed TCP connection, video stream, on which is filling the buffers. Getting the web page uses the same connection, so it is slower because the packets may be dropped or have a longer processing time.

Part 4:
Ping avg: 20ms
4.450s wget time

Part 5 First part:
wget before iperf: 1.0s
Ping avg before iperf: 20ms

Ping avg after iperf: 138ms
wget after iperf: 2.700s

Why does reducing the queue size reduce the download time for wget?
When you put it on a larger queue all packets get delayed due to bufferbloat. Packets from the high speed connection are delaying packets from the single wget command because it has to wait for more packets in the queue.

Part 5 Different Queues:
wget before iperf: 1.0s
Ping avg before iperf: 20ms

wget after iperf: 2.000s
Ping avg after iperf: 20ms

The ping remains the same for before and after iperf, but wget still takes twice as long.
